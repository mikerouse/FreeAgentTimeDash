# Chrome Identity API Setup Guide

## Overview
Your Chrome extension now uses Chrome Identity API for secure OAuth authentication with FreeAgent. This eliminates the need to store client secrets in the extension.

## Setup Steps

### 1. Register Your Extension with FreeAgent

1. Go to FreeAgent Developer Portal: https://dev.freeagent.com/
2. Create a new application or update your existing one
3. Set the redirect URI to: 
   ```
   https://<EXTENSION_ID>.chromiumapp.org/
   ```
   Where `<EXTENSION_ID>` is your Chrome extension's ID (found in chrome://extensions when developer mode is on)

### 2. Configure the Extension

1. Open `auth.js`
2. Replace `YOUR_FREEAGENT_CLIENT_ID` with your actual FreeAgent Client ID (line 4)
3. Do NOT include the client_secret anywhere in the extension

### 3. Important Considerations

#### Token Exchange Options

The current implementation has three possible approaches for the token exchange:

**Option A: Public Client (Preferred if FreeAgent supports it)**
- Configure your FreeAgent app as a "public" client that doesn't require client_secret
- This is the simplest and most secure option for browser extensions

**Option B: Backend Proxy Server (Most Secure)**
- Set up a simple backend server (Node.js, Python, etc.)
- Store your client_secret on the server
- The extension calls your server, which then exchanges the code with FreeAgent
- Update `auth.js` to use `exchangeCodeViaProxy()` method

**Option C: PKCE Flow (If FreeAgent supports OAuth 2.0 PKCE)**
- Modern OAuth flow designed for public clients
- No client_secret needed
- Requires FreeAgent to support PKCE extension

### 4. Testing the Authentication

1. Load the extension in Chrome (developer mode)
2. Click the extension icon
3. Click "Connect FreeAgent"
4. Chrome will open a FreeAgent login window
5. Authorize the application
6. The extension will receive the tokens securely

### 5. Security Benefits

✅ **No client_secret in extension code**
✅ **Chrome handles secure redirect**
✅ **Tokens stored in Chrome's secure storage**
✅ **Automatic token refresh support**
✅ **No need for oauth.html callback page**

## Troubleshooting

### "Token exchange failed" Error
This likely means FreeAgent requires a client_secret. You'll need to:
1. Set up a backend proxy server, OR
2. Configure FreeAgent to accept public clients, OR
3. Check if FreeAgent supports PKCE flow

### "Invalid redirect_uri" Error
Make sure the redirect URI in FreeAgent matches exactly:
```
https://<YOUR_EXTENSION_ID>.chromiumapp.org/
```

### Getting Your Extension ID
1. Go to chrome://extensions
2. Enable Developer Mode
3. Find your extension
4. Copy the ID shown under the extension name

## Backend Proxy Status

✅ **Proxy Server Deployed!**

Your OAuth proxy server is now running at:
```
https://freeagenttimedash.onrender.com
```

The proxy server securely handles:
- Token exchange with client_secret
- Token refresh
- All OAuth operations requiring the secret

The extension's `auth.js` has been configured to use this proxy URL.

## Chrome Web Store Submission

With this implementation, your extension is ready for Chrome Web Store submission:
- ✅ No hardcoded secrets
- ✅ Uses Chrome's secure OAuth flow
- ✅ Follows Chrome extension best practices
- ✅ Secure token storage

## Next Steps

1. Test the authentication flow
2. Decide which token exchange method to use (based on FreeAgent's OAuth capabilities)
3. Implement backend proxy if needed
4. Submit to Chrome Web Store with confidence!
