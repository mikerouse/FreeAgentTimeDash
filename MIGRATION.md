# Chrome Extension Migration

This directory contains the original Chrome extension files that have been replaced by the desktop Electron app.

## ✅ **Migration Complete**

The Chrome extension has been successfully converted to a desktop application. These files are kept for reference:

### **Original Extension Files**
- `popup.html` - Original extension popup (replaced by `src/renderer/index.html`)
- `popup.js` - Original extension logic (replaced by `src/renderer/js/time-tracker.js`)
- `freeagent-api.js` - Original API (replaced by `src/renderer/js/freeagent-api.js`)
- `auth.js` - Original auth (replaced by OAuth server)
- `manifest.json` - Extension manifest (replaced by `package.json`)

### **Desktop App Files**
- `src/renderer/index.html` - Modern desktop UI
- `src/renderer/js/time-tracker.js` - Enhanced timer logic
- `src/renderer/js/freeagent-api.js` - Desktop-adapted API
- `src/main/oauth-server.js` - OAuth authentication server
- `main.js` - Electron main process

## 🚀 **What's Improved**

### **UI/UX Enhancements**
- ✅ **Proper Sizing**: No more cramped 500px extension popup
- ✅ **Better Forms**: Spacious timeslip creation with proper validation
- ✅ **Professional Design**: Desktop-grade interface with better typography
- ✅ **Slide Panels**: Smooth animations instead of modal overlays

### **System Integration**
- ✅ **System Tray**: Always-available timer controls
- ✅ **Global Shortcuts**: Alt+1/2/3 work from any application
- ✅ **Native Notifications**: Professional system notifications
- ✅ **Window Management**: Minimize to tray, proper desktop behavior

### **Technical Improvements**
- ✅ **Better OAuth**: Proper authentication flow with local server
- ✅ **Secure Storage**: Encrypted data storage with electron-store
- ✅ **Auto Updates**: Background updates via GitHub releases
- ✅ **Cross Platform**: Windows, macOS, Linux support
- ✅ **Better Performance**: No browser overhead or extension limitations

## 📦 **How to Use Desktop App**

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run in development
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build
```

## 🗑️ **Cleanup Plan**

These original files can be safely removed after confirming the desktop app works correctly:

```bash
# Remove old extension files (when ready)
rm popup.html popup.js auth.js manifest.json
rm -rf old-extension-assets/
```
